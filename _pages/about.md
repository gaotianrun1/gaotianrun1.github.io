<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third year Ph.D. student at [School of Civil Engineering, Tongji University](https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), advised by Prof. Hongwei Huang ([Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H-Huang-4)). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2022, majoring in Civil Engineering. 

My researches focus on:                                                                                          
·Experimental and numerical methods for the simulation of tunneling influence;                                          
·Physics-informed intelligent assessment and control of impact on complex infrastructure systems;                       
·Automated numerical modeling and AI for scientific simulation & design.
