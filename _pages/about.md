I am a master student at [School of Civil Engineering, Tongji University](https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), advised by Prof. Hongwei Huang. 
Currently, I am studying as internship at [AI for Scientifc Simulation and Discovery Lab](https://ai4s.lab.westlake.edu.cn/) in the AI department of Westlake University, supervised by [Prof. Tailin Wu](https://tailin.org/).
I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2022, majoring in Civil Engineering. 

My researches mainly focus on:                                                                                                                              
·AI for physical simulation & design & control & discovery.
·Mechanics and AI empowered mechanics.                
·Robotics and Generative AI for science.                      
·Automated numerical simulation of mechanical & engineering systems and uncertainty analysis.
