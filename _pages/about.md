<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third year master student at [School of Civil Engineering, Tongji University](https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), advised by Prof. Hongwei Huang. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2022, majoring in Civil Engineering. 

My researches mainly focus on:                                                                                                                              
·AI for Science and graphics (physical simulation & design & control & discovery).                   
·Physics-informed modeling and control of complex engineering systems.                      
·Automated numerical and experimental methods in engineering.
